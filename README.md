# TypeScript: Udemy

### Following along with the **Understanding Typescript** course on Udemy.com

## Notes on Sections

#### Section 9: Decorators
There must be a version mismatch here. Used TS 2.6.2 during the tutorials and it's been working with the exception of the **Factories** part of this section.

Going to seek out another source to try & learn about Decorators & Factories since they look cool but this particular tutorial isn't any help unless I'm using the same TS version Max was.
